                My Hobbies!
            </p>
            <p class="introduction">
                I have a lot of different hobbies that I can talk about, but you will get to know three of them!
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>My first hobby is reading. It can be from books, novels, to fanfiction. It depends on what I can find that catches my interest.</li>
                <li>My second hobby is creating things. 3D modeling too. At the moment I am quite limited on what I can do in the real world, but if I have the time, I like to spend time in the games I play creating a lot of different things!</li>
                <li>My third and the last hobby I will talk about is playing games. It is one of my biggest hobbies. Open world, sandbow, survival, you name it. I like all of them.</li>
